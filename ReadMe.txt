 SharpOcarina was originally written by xdaniel 2011-2012, using some code by spinout adapted from C and/or
 Python to C#, but in reality is also the product of numerous people who were involved with
 modifying and documenting the Zelda games for the N64 (spinout, MNGoldenEagle, JSA et al.)

 In 2017, Nokaubure followed the development of the tool with the 0.70-0.97 version.
