SharpOcarina v1.51 - Zelda OoT Scene Development System
             Revived in 2017-2024 by Nokaubure, started in 2011/2012 by xdaniel
Find me on: https://discord.gg/74pHDEU
------------------------------------------------------

Due SharpOcarina being the only tool in the z64rom workflow to be closed sourced, and a change in my mindset, I decided to make it open source again.
This change will allow users to adapt SharpOcarina to their needs or modifications they made to z64rom.
If you're willing to improve it or you made a change that you want to share with the rest, DM me on discord and I will 
decide if it should be pushed to the main branch or not, I want to avoid having different versions / branches of SharpOcarina

 SharpOcarina was originally written by xdaniel 2011-2012, using some code by spinout adapted from C and/or
 Python to C#, but in reality is also the product of numerous people who were involved with
 modifying and documenting the Zelda games for the N64 (spinout, MNGoldenEagle, JSA et al.)

 In 2017, Nokaubure followed the development of the tool with the 0.70-1.4x version.
