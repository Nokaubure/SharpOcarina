--------------
---1.32
--------------

- Added support to a hack that allows creating custom scene functions inside SO along with a new tab (OoT debug ROM only). Features:
	- Scrolling textures
	- Color blending
	- Changing textures
	- Special camera effects
	- Conditional draw
	- All the above can react to flags, such as switch flags, time of day, global flags...

- Custom render functions and MM scrolling textures can be visualized with N64 render mode

- Added new 2 patches
	- Advanced texture animations (this one is required for the new system of texture animations to work, thanks a lot to z64me, the one who coded it!)
	- Extend dynapoly vertex limit (in OoT, placing a lot of actors with collision such as 30 stalactite crashes the game, this is due the game only allowing 512 vertex of actor collision. This patch increases it by 8 times more)

- Fixed an issue where SO accounted #NoCollision vertex when throwing the 8192 vertex warning as well as making the game crash by pushing vertex IDs past 8192

- #Doublesided collision tag removed (this tag served as an early version of #Door tag and was bad practice since Link can go past a doublesided collision with a jumpslash)

- Opening an MM rom as global rom now switches SO to MM mode

- Fixed an issue where minutes and hours in room env were not saved propertly

- Fixed an issue that would occur sometimes if you deleted additional textures

- Added checkbox to disable start time and changed start time format so now it appears as hours and minutes

- Added a toggleable setting to autofix or help fixing common errors. Does the following:
	- Warns about transitions leading to nonexistent rooms, and sets them to 0
	- Warns about transitions having nonexistent cameras, and sets them to FF
	- Warns about prerendered scenes not being setup correctly, and fixes them

--------------

- Added 2 new collision flags in the poly tab as well as their respective tags (#Ice, #KillingQuicksandNoJump)

- Added collision movement, in which you can make link move to specific direction when steping on it. 
	Also added tags for it: #Direction00 and #Speed0, where 00 and 0 is the amount in hex

- Added an option to export all textures to a pixelated format (smooth texture shading off)

- Fixed a bug where multitextures couldn't be saved into the xml at all

- Polytype flags now treats TAG_ as # symbol (for sketchup users ¬¬')

- A few rendered actors now show matrices propertly (failed attempt, it was meant to fix all of them)

- Scene ID now caps at 6D, preventing ROM corruption if people used non-existing IDs by mistake

- Renamed Fog Unknown to Transition Speed

- An error message will appear if you attempt to open the 64 bit executable without renaming it first

- An error message will appear if a mesh or collision vertex is further than 32767 units on both sides

- Polytype environments now have the correct documentation in the tooltip



--------------
---0.975 (beta phase 6)
--------------

- The application now requires NET framework 4.5 instead of 4.0

- Added alternate headers. This is a list of all the tabs and how they are handled:
	- General: Everything is shared with normal header, except the prerendered image path
	- Rooms: Everything is shared with normal header
	- Scene Env: Duplicated when you add the alternate header, all values are independent
	- Room Env: Duplicated when you add the alternate header, all values are independent
	- Collision & Exits: Everything is shared with normal header
	- Transitions & Spawns: Duplicated when you add the alternate header, all values are independent
	- Pathways: Duplicated when you add the alternate header, all values are independent
	- Objects & Actors: Duplicated when you add the alternate header, all values are independent
	- Cutscene: Blank, all values are independent
The autoadd objects feature also detects missing objects in the alternate headers.
Adding or deleting rooms on the main header will reset the rooms of all the alternate headers. Reload button will do it if the amount of rooms change.

- Added 3 new collision flags in the polytype tab, as well as their respective tags (#IgnoreCamera, #IgnoreActors, #IgnoreProjectiles)

- Added a debug option to import environments from .zscene files (useful for copying environments from vanilla scenes)

- Fixed a bug where SO crashes when you create a new scene while having the n64 rendering enabled

- Fixed a bug where SO crashes when canceling a scene opening, and then opening another

- Fixed a bug where actor files were loaded into the RAM regardless of having actor rendering enabled or not

- Fixed a bug where save to binary option crashed if you opened the old file with a hex editor

- Fixed a bug where save to binary option was reusing old data from previous exports if filename was the same

- Exit, transitions and pathway commands are no longer written if there's no exits, transitions or pathways in the scene, and wind command is not written if all 4 wind values are 00

- The previous title card fix didn't work, so I'm doing another attempt. This time it has another algorythm to import the font, and if it still fails, Arial font will loaded instead, so people without windows 10 can atleast use the import button.

- New tags from previous update weren't documented in the xml, now they do. Also fixed a few incorrect ones, like grass and carpet

- Autoadd objects will now delete objects 0000-0003 while warning you

- Added print offsets on inject option. This prints the cutscene offset, the start and end offsets of scene and rooms, and in the case of MM, the dma offset

- Zobj exporter now allows banks 0x04 and 0x05

--------------
---0.974 (beta phase 5)
--------------

 - Around 10 more actors are rendered now

 - Fog distance is now splitted in 2 fields

 - Scene id is now in hex

 - Majora's mask actors rotation are now correctly converted, and they will always spawn on all 5 days (provisional)

 - Added option to disable cutscene camera dummy points (use it to edit vanilla cutscenes only)

 - Fixed a bug where SO crashed when trying to render meshes with no uv coords

--------------
---0.973 (beta phase 4)
--------------


- Added restriction flag editor (only OOT). This is an independent addon like the entrance table editor, meaning you have to pick a ROM.

- Added support to TGA texture format

- Added a way to add textures directly to the scene (for multitexturing)

- Added more cutscene actors and misc actions

- Around 20 more actors are rendered now

- Added 3 more scene rendering functions

- Exporting to zobj now ignores dlist culling setting

- Blender export script no longer replaces the normal blender .obj exporter

- Fixed a bug where duplicating an actor with shiftclick would make its coordinates go back to the previous actor if not moved with the mouse

- Fixed a bug where textures were written multiple times, increasing the scene file size

- (probably rolling back this since it lags) Fixed a bug where N64 rendering was not updated when making changes to the groups

- Ancient bug spoted: Multitextures only works in RGBA mode, and SO converts the particular textures when enabling multitexture. While I'm trying to fix this bug, use only rgba textures for multitexturing.

--------------
---0.972 (beta phase 3)
--------------

- Fixed a minor bug where reloading a room didn't reseted the settings correctly

- Adding cutscene textboxes defaults to message 0xFFFF (idle textbox), and all the cutscene commands now defaults at 1 frame

- Cutscene actors rotation values can now be incremented by 1820 units when holding shift, and react to Z and X buttons when moving with mouse

- SO no longer requires internet conection or hylianmodding website to be up in order to run

--------------
---0.971 (beta phase 2)
--------------

- Fixed a critical bug where sometimes the scene XML wasn't saved (the reason of this release lol)

- Fixed a bug where multitextures displayed a lot of error messages

- Added some cutscene actor commands 

- Added description for all the cutscene transition effects

- Added some cutscene misc actions

- Added new cutscene marker: Set Time

- Frame duration of cutscenes, textboxes and actor actions are now numeric fields, as well as fov and camera roll

- Cutscene actor actions now allow setting rotation values (do note that Y rotation is updated automatically if you make them move)

- More actors are rendered now (nearly all enemies, jabujabu and lake hylia actors, some platforms and cuttable grass)

- DLists have 1-2 less commands, depending on the texture type

- DLists now allow multitexture+transparent+vertex colour combination

- DLists now allow having vertex alpha value (SO will fail to render them if you enable lighting, but they are visible ingame)

- Added autoupdate

--------------
---0.97 (beta)
--------------

New stuff

- Added Collision tags. Its a new system to assign polytypes on your collision, basically naming the groups in the collision file with the tags found in the file XML\OOT\ModelFlags.xml (you must read this file) will make SO ignore the settings and create polytypes based on those tags. 

- Added Autoadd transition actors. This feature uses #Door and #BlackPlane tags to add transition actors with variables already configured.

- Added loading multiple rooms at once. Sometimes when making a very large scene with multiple rooms, like dungeons, you may find it better to keep all rooms on the same .obj. Now you can do this with #Room tags on each group. SO will split the mesh groups between rooms using this flag.

- Added Cutscene tab. This feature is so complex to explain it, I hope you can figure it yourself. I will make a tutorial at some point. Its incomplete so far, but it does the job.

- Added Fixed Cameras. The default camera following link is no longer the only one, you can use a wide variety of cameras! to swap between cameras ingame use the camera ID setting in polytypes. Tip: Add them with shift+click, that way they will be in the exact same position as the SO camera.


- Added Prerendered scenes (only single background for now). Generate a JFIF image using this website: http://convertonlinefree.com/ConvertImageEN.aspx, load it and set camera settings to 0x10 (fixed camera prerendered backgrounds), and lastly set camera type to a fixed one, like 0x19.

- Added title card editor (the letters that appear when entering a scene). This will directly inject into the rom, meaning that its independent, like the entrance editor.

- Now it remembers the last 10 opened scenes and the last 10 injected roms

- Autosave feature. Each 1 minute of not being idle, the scene will be saved into XML\autosave.xml

- Added a field to configure multitexture transparency value

- Undo/Redo (only for actors, transitions and spawns, this will change after the beta to allow more stuff). Press ctrl+Z for undo and ctrl+Y (temporal shortcut) for redo while being in the rendering window (you may have to click the frame first).

- Save is now splitted into Save and Save As.

- Added launch rom button, which just mimics double clicking the rom in the explorer.

- Now tooltips appear when you hover the mouse in the polytype fields.

- Added a button to reload mesh. This is beta and its sole purpose is to fix a rare bug where the entire scene mesh explodes.

- Now it renders a higher amount of actors, added support to render actors with animations and actors in objects 0001-0003

- Added a hidden easter egg


- Minimal MM support (all offsets are set to GCN USA, I recommend you using this Rom, however you can change the offsets in the config file), stuff that currently works:
	- able to inject working scenes and rooms
	- actors, objects and music XMLs are updated if you turn MM mode on. Actor database doesn't have variables. Autoadd objects works. The rest of the dropdown list uses OOT values.
	- cutscenes and cutscene entrance table editor are disabled
	- entrance table editor supports it and uses MM scene names
	- while minimaps, actor cameras and multitexture commands are injected, you're not able to edit them, this will change in a future remote version
	- actors still use OOT rotation system, this will change after the beta
	- due to MM having a different system, OOT multitexture options will not work
	- clear dma table is disabled (since its oot debug rom only), this is a issue with MM and that's why I wanted to delay it as much as possible. Currently SO will only update the scene dma entry and the first room, meaning that you can inject single room scenes without hex edit. However as long as you have more than 1 room you will need to hex edit the dma table and to make things worst, you can only use the same amount of rooms as the scene you're replacing. If you know a solution about this, or you're willing to make an assembly hack for MM that skips dma table just like debug rom contact me.

bug fixes

- bug fixed: item dropdowns now displays the entire text

- bug fixed: backface culling works again

- bug fixed: trying to injecting/save/rendering with no scene function or ganon tower collapse function will no longer crash

- bug fixed: auto-update CRC no longer triggers if you cancel ROM injection

- bug fixed: adding actors and spawns had blackplane actor values by default. Now it defaults to a green rupee if its an actor, or a link spawner if its a spawn.

- bug fixed: actor database filter is no longer case-sensitive with var names

- bug fixed: pathways and objects are now limited to 15 entries. If autoadd objects adds more than 15, it will shout a warning message.

- bug fixed: updating crc no longer breaks with spaces in the filename

- bug fixed: auto-place actors now works with multiple rooms



Known Bugs

- Actor rendering is ofcourse unfinished. Some rendered actors look bad (like dark link), others are missaligned like rupees, and some others have missmatching models (like golden skulltulas having skullwaltula model). Additionally, actors use the same mouse hitbox as when you don't render them, making some of them dificult to grab

- Scrolling the mouse wheel extremely fast when selecting actors/transitions/spawns makes SO fail to load the actor data propertly, replacing them with a duplicate of another one.

- Sometimes, while manipulating the cutscene editor, if you attempt to open another scene xml SO will crash


--------------
-----0.93-----
--------------

Improvements and new stuff

- Now you can use vertex color and transparency at the same time

- More types of animation are now available. Do note that SO will force the mesh to follow the rules of the selected animation no matter 
what you choose, for example if you assign an opaque texture animation to a transparent mesh, it will become opaque.

- Addded a checkbox to enable continual inject (will make SO behave like HT and injecting the room after the scene). Setting the same inject offset for scene and room does the same effect.

- Added a new setting in groups: metallic textures (a.k.a spherical textures). This setting is skipped when you use texture animations.

- Added an option to update the crc everytime you inject a scene

- Same textures used by 2 or more rooms are not written twice or more times

- CI4 / CI8  textures using the same palette no longer write the same palette more times (including between rooms)

- DList are now culled ofcamera ingame. This increases the room size a bit so I also added an option to disable it.

- Group highlight now only appears when the selected tab is "Rooms"

- Added entrance cutscene table editor. Its only purpose is to disable cutscenes from playing since cutscene editor is unfinished.

- Added a 64-bit version of the executable

Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug were only 1 pathway was saved

- Fixed a bug were entrance table used decimal numbers instead of hex, which was not the intendeed behaviour

- Fixed a bug were unused materials were written in the room files 

- Fixed a bug were fog distance and draw distance were not saved unless you pressed enter key

- Fixed a bug were entrance table saved entries in a bad order if you sorted it, messing the whole rom table

- Fixed a bug were transition actors switch and cam fields weren't duplicated with the duplicate button

- Fixed a bug were transition actors switch and cam fields were filled with garbage values when using the add button

- Adjusted the mouse hitbox and axis so it matches the custom door model. Doors that aren't transition actors will also be displayed with the door model now.

- When the crc is updated, now it displays the succesful command line


Debug features

- Actor filling is now inside debug tab

- Added an option to render actors (very experimental, you can only render very few actors, unless you update the XML, note that variables are ignored right now)

- Added an option to create a pathway that surrounds the selected group


--------------
-----0.91-----
--------------

Improvements

- Added an option to disable waterbox movement

- Now you can save the options in a .xml, they will be loaded everytime you open SO

- Added an option to clear the dma table of a rom. Use this if you experience crashes ingame. (this also updates the crc)

Bug fixes

- Auto-add objects no longer crashes when saving scene

- Sticking actors to ground/ceiling now uses Z/X keys to prevent shortcut bugs

- Entrance table now refreshes the scene name column more often

--------------
-----0.90-----
--------------

Improvements

- Fields are now saved when losing focus. Enter key is no longer required.

- Hold shift while adding or duplicating an instance to create it in front of the camera

- Added room selection for waterboxes. Default value is 3F which enables them on all rooms

- Now its easier to tell where the instance is facing (light-green extreme = front of the instance)

- Transition actors are rendered as rectangles of the same size as ingame doors

- Use mouse wheel after moving an actor to rotate it. Waterboxes will change their size instead.

- Use up and down keys while moving an actor to stick to ceiling/ground


New stuff

- Actor database added for actors, transitions and spawns. Click on the blue button next to actor number to open it. You can type a word to filter actors. 
Note that if a variable contains the word, the entire actor will be displayed. You can also use special filters like #Transitions and #Monsters.

- Added entrance list. SO auto-generates it based on where you place the spawnpoints. The entrance number is the same as the order of the spawns, so the spawn 2 will be the entrance 2.

- Added support to vertex colors. You must replace the export_obj.py of your blender 2.7x with the one in the blenderscripts folder.

- Added an entrance table editor. This editor is independent so you can change the entrance table without injecting anything in the rom.


Bugfixes & tweaks

- Greatly improved the lighting of the imported maps by fixing a bug related to normals

- Fixed a crash that involved moving an instance outside room boundaries

- Fixed bug where maps made with blender couldn't have vertex groups

- Fixed a bug where you could not save polytype assigned to the first group in the first room

- Fixed a crash when attempting to delete the last polytype of the scene

- Fixed a crash when typing on room offset when there's no rooms

- [Temporal fix] animated opaque textures will be injected as transparent to avoid crashing

- Reduced byte padding (less kb per scene)

- When importing .obj, groups with 0 triangles are ignored

--------------
-----0.82-----
--------------

Bugfixes & tweaks

- Fixed a bug where around 20% of the actors where missing in the XML files. Now there's all actors known by cloudmodding wiki.

- Fixed a critical bug where the application would crash if you change the alpha value of an animated texture.

- Fixed a bug where all vertex colors were set to yellow if the .obj came from sketchup or gray if the .obj came from blender.

- Changed the outdoor light option (again!). Now it has been moved to scene environment and is called "Enable lighting A-E", since that's the real function it does. 
It's also enabled by default now.

Collision:

- Added "Camera Angle" numeric box. Use 0x0B for ladders, 0x04 and 0x05 for crawlspaces.

- Added "Ladder Top" ,"Crawl Space" , "Killing Lava" , "Jabu-Jabu" and "No Fall Damage" checkboxes

Other:

- If autoadd objects is ON, the application will warn you if you place 0x0002 or 0x0003 actors with the incorrect special object.

- Added "Use environment 1 on all rooms" in extra tab. This option sets time values in a way that only environment setting 1 will be used.

- Added "Show Controls" in help tab.

--------------
-----0.81-----

- Reverb field is now correctly capped at 0x0E

- Fixed a crash when loading scenes with nonexisting filepaths

- Now when loading a scene, if it fails to open the .obj files it will try to find them on the same folder as the xml, useful for move XMLs across computers

- Fixed minor display bugs with pathways and additional lights


--------------
-----0.80-----
--------------

Waterboxes

- Hold shift to increment/decrement size by 20 units

Additional lights (unused)

- Added additional lights (unused)

- There are 2 types: point lights and directional lights

- Only point lights are displayed in the editor. +-20 units shift and mouse control are enabled on point lights.

Options tab

- Added an option to hide item axis


Extra tab

- Set default environment list values: This sets environment values to default (same as when you create a new scene)

- Set haunted wasteland wind values: Sets wind values to those in haunted wasteland, recomended if you don't want to mess with the weird wind values

- Copy first room env. settings to all rooms: Useful to set the same settings on all rooms by only changing the first one. Additional lights are skipped because of their weird nature.


Misc.

- Moved some options and added new tabs

- Changed application name and icon

- Added credits and special thanks to the readme (the rest of the readme is unchanged)

--------------
-----0.70-----
--------------

Actors, transition actors, spawn points

- The name of the actor is displayed (example, 0025 = lizalfos)

- Now they are displayed on a list

- Duplicate button

- Options to stick an actor to a wall, ground or ceiling

- You can select them with right click

- You can move them with middle click. Hold shift to move them front and back.

- Hold shift and click the numeric positions to increase/decrease them by 20 units instead of 1

- A "Degrees" option to multiply rotations by 182.044444444 after pressing enter.

- Dropdown to select variables for transition actors (doors and black plane)


Objects

- Selecting an object displays it's internal name, size in hex and the actors that use this object

- On save, the application will automatically add missing objects (checks all rooms). You can disable this with "Autoadd objects" option.

- A maxium object space appears. If the sum of your object sizes is bigger than this limit, it will turn red.


Waterboxes

- Now they have different coloration when unselected.

- Hold shift and click the numeric positions to increase/decrease them by 20 units instead of 1


BGM

- BGM can be selected with a dropdown list. The name and id of the BGMs can be changed by editing SongName.xml (for custom BGM)


Bugfixes

- Fixed the option "Emulate N64 Graphics".

- It's now GLideN64 compatible (it should work in N64 too, I guess)

- When you add an actor, it now appears in the center of the current room


Extras (experimental)

I was using these functions to quickly test the changes I was making, but I decided to keep them just for fun. Actors are never placed oob or mid-air, however when there are multiple rooms, they have a low chance to be placed on a near room collision plane.

- Fill room with enemies clear-flag: randomly places 9 different enemies and a clear flag chest. Use ROM pointer hacks to avoid maximum object space crash or delete some enemies.

- Fill room with silver rupees switch-flag: randomly places silver rupee puzzle and a switch flag chest.


Known bugs

- Very rarely the textures disappear when the window loses focus with Emulate N64 Graphics On, to fix this just reenable the option.

- If you open the top menu and you cancel it by clicking on the render window, the camera does a weird rotation. Click somewhere else to avoid this.
