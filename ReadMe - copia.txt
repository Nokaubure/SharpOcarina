Name: Sets the name of the file, only relevant when you save the file in binary mode. No effect ingame.
Scale: Sets the scale of the imported model.
Injection Offset: Sets the injection address, you must change this field for every scene if you're going to make multiple maps for a romhack.
Special Object: Each special object has a set of actors. You will see more information about this with the actor database button.
Navi C-up tips: You can select which set of tips navi will give to the player
Simulate N64 Graphics: The program will try to render the scene like in a N64 emulator. The output is better with light disabled since the program doesn't calculate day/night cycles yet.
Collision

 SharpOcarina was written by xdaniel 2011-2012, using some code by spinout adapted from C and/or
 Python to C#, but in reality is also the product of numerous people who were involved with
 modifying and documenting the Zelda games for the N64 (spinout, MNGoldenEagle, JSA et al.)

 In 2017, Nokaubure followed the development of the tool with the 0.70-0.93 version.
